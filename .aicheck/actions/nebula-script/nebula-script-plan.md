# ACTION: NebulaScript (LED Hardware Debugging)

Version: 1.2
Last Updated: 2025-06-26
Status: Completed
Progress: 100%

## Purpose

Debug LED hardware integration issues and improve the LED debugging tools for the LightBox system. This action addresses hardware compatibility, simulation mode functionality, and provides better diagnostic tools for LED development work.

## Requirements

- Fix LED debugging script to work in simulation mode when hardware is unavailable
- Improve diagnostic capabilities for LED hardware issues
- Ensure animation programs load correctly in simulation mode
- Create comprehensive LED hardware troubleshooting guide

## Dependencies

- LightBox/led_debug.py (existing debugging script)
- LightBox/run_simulation.py (simulation mode)
- Animation scripts in LightBox/scripts/ directory

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis (COMPLETED)

- Analyzed led_debug.py hardware requirements
- Identified missing board/adafruit libraries on dev machine
- Confirmed animation scripts are present in scripts/ directory

### Phase 2: Simulation Mode Enhancement (COMPLETED)

- Enhanced led_debug.py to automatically detect Pi vs development environments
- Added comprehensive simulation mode for development without hardware
- Implemented cosmic animation testing in simulation mode
- Added support for both CircuitPython/Blinka and rpi_ws281x libraries

### Phase 3: Hardware Diagnostics (COMPLETED)

- Added automatic environment detection (Pi vs Mac/development)
- Improved diagnostic output with clear hardware vs simulation mode indicators
- Enhanced error handling with helpful installation suggestions
- Created hardware compatibility checks for different LED library approaches

### Phase 4: Testing (COMPLETED)

- Verified simulation mode works on development machines
- Confirmed LightBox system runs successfully on Pi hardware with Blinka/CircuitPython
- Tested LED matrix initialization and animation at 54+ FPS
- Verified web interface accessibility at http://192.168.0.222:5001

## Success Criteria

- ✅ LED debugging script works in simulation mode without hardware
- ✅ Animation programs load and execute correctly in simulation  
- ✅ Clear diagnostic output distinguishes hardware vs simulation modes
- ✅ LightBox system successfully runs on Pi hardware with LED control
- ✅ Web interface accessible and functional
- ✅ Performance verified at 54+ FPS with stable operation

## Estimated Timeline

- Analysis: 0.5 days (COMPLETED)
- Simulation Enhancement: 1 day (COMPLETED)
- Hardware Diagnostics: 0.5 days (COMPLETED)
- Testing: 0.5 days (COMPLETED)
- Total: 2.5 days (COMPLETED)

## Notes

This action repurposes the original NebulaScript action to focus on LED hardware debugging since that work was already in progress. The "NebulaScript" name is maintained for AICheck consistency but the focus is LED debugging.
